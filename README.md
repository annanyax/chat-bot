# Chatbot Terminal

Welcome to the Chatbot Terminal!

This project is a simple chatbot interface that mimics a terminal, allowing users to interact with a Python-based chatbot. The chatbot uses a knowledge base to provide answers to user questions and can be extended by contributions from users.

## Access the Chatbot

You can access the chatbot directly through this link: [annanyasah.com/chatbot](https://annanyasah.com/chatbot)

## About the Code

This chatbot is built using Python and serves a simple web interface to simulate a terminal. The chatbot relies on a knowledge base (`knowledge_base.json`) to find the best match for user inputs and respond accordingly. If the chatbot doesn't understand a question, it can be taught new answers, making it an evolving, community-driven project.

### Features

- **Terminal-like Interface**: The web interface looks and feels like a terminal.
- **Knowledge Base**: Uses a JSON file to store questions and answers.
- **Community Contributions**: Users can teach the chatbot new answers directly.
